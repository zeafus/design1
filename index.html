      <h1>Art is OK</h1>

<p>by Susie Ramsay and Rafael Lozano-Hemmer</p>

<p>1. "OK art" is an OK idea, --not great, but not bad either.</p>

<p>2. OK artists make OK art.</p>

<p>3. OK artists really want to make great art, they shoot for the stars, but
their work ends up being just OK. OK artists are OK with this.</p>

<p>4. Art enthusiasts and cynics alike, leave an OK art exhibition saying
"that was OK". No one is blown away but they don't feel cheated either.</p>

<p>5. OK art will probably not make it into art history; although someone in
the future might find an OK artwork and think "this isn't so bad."</p>

<p>6. "Different" and "interesting" are two adjectives often overheard at OK
art exhibitions.</p>

<p>7. OK artists are OK with bad reviews, but naturally they prefer good
reviews and they keep those and post them on the internet.</p>

<p>8. It's a good idea to call yourself an OK artist before somebody else
does.</p>

<p>9. Ambitious, megalomaniac artists feel great relief when they accept
they're just OK.</p>

<p>10. OK ideas are defended passionately but not more than that.</p>

<p>11. (this point was erased during editing)</p>

<p>12. OK art is unlikely to be over or underrated.</p>

<p>13. We hate artists that are A-OK, those bastards!</p>

<p>14. There is no point in making an OK art movement, although fleeting
consideration of the concept would be OK.</p>
